					<h1><span style="font-size:160px">XML</span></h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is XML?</h2> 
						<ul>
							<li>XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language </li>
							<li>XML is a markup language much like HTML </li>
							<ul>
								<li>More accurately defined as a metalanguage </li>
							</ul>
							<li>XML was designed to describe data </li>
							<li>XML tags are not predefined. You define your own tags depending on the application </li>
							<li>XML is a W3C Recommendation - 1998 </li>
						</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What XML do?</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>Xml is used to structure and describe information. </li>
						<li>Intended to be used with the internet. </li>
						<li>Xml can be used as a way to interchange data between disparate systems. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Difference Between XML and HTML</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>XML was designed to carry data. </li>
						<li>XML is not a replacement for HTML. </li>
						<li>XML and HTML were designed with different goals: </li>
						<ul>
							<li>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is. </li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks. </li>
						</ul>
						<li>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>XML Does Not DO Anything</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>XML was not designed to DO anything. </li>
						<li>XML was created to structure, store and to send information. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Advantages of XML</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>Information can be easily read and understood. </li>
						<li>Specific tags that target specific problems can be easily created. </li>
						<li>Xml data can be exchanged between systems that were not designed to do so. </li>
						<li>Xml is an open format that can be proccessed by any xml-aware application like- browser, word processor, spreedsheet etc.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Potential Drawbacks of XML</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Xml is not especially good at handling very large amounts of data.</li>
						<li>Xml can quickly become difficult to read if a lot of information is included in one file </li>
						<li>Certain types of data like-images are not represented well in xml.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>XML is a Complement to HTML</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>It is important to understand that XML is not a replacement for HTML. In future Web development it is most likely that XML will be used to describe the data, while HTML will be used to format and display the same data. </li>
						<li>XML is a cross-platform, software and hardware independent tool for transmitting information. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>XML is Used to Exchange Data</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>With XML, data can be exchanged between incompatible systems. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Computer systems and databases contain data in incompatible formats. One of the most time-consuming challenges for developers has been to exchange data between such systems over the Internet. </li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Converting the data to XML can greatly reduce this complexity and create data that can be read by many different types of applications. </li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>XML Can Be Used to Share Data</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>Since XML data is stored in plain text format, XML provides a software- and hardware-independent way of sharing data. </li>
						<li>This makes it much easier to create data that different applications can work with. It also makes it easier to expand or upgrade a system to new operating systems, servers, applications, and new browsers.  </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>XML Can Make Data More Useful</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>With XML, your data is available to more users. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Since XML is independent of hardware, software and application, you can make your data available to other than only standard HTML browsers. </li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Other clients and applications can access your XML files as data sources, like they are accessing databases. Your data can be made available to all kinds of &quot;reading machines&quot; (agents). </li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Editors</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>XML files can be edited using any text editor: </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Windows: Notepad, NotePad++, EditPad Lite, etc </li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Mac OS: Text Wrangler, BBEdit, TextMate </li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux: Gedit, VIM, Geany, etc. </li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Viewing XML Files in a Web Browser</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>XML documents can be opened in Internet Explorer or in Firefox. </li>
						<li>If there are no syntax errors: </li>
						<ul>
							<li>IE and Firefox will display the document’s contents in an expandable/collapsible outline format including all markup tags. </li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Style Sheets & XML</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>There are two main style sheet languages used with XML: </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Extensible Style Sheets (XSL) </li>
						</ul>
						<li>The important benefits to using style sheets are the same as using them with XHTML docs. </li>
					</ul>
